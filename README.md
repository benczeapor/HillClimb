To open the compiled program:
  1. Download zip
  2. Extract
  3. Go to ```HillClimb/bin/debug/net8.0```
  4. Open ```hillclimb.exe``` and enjoy!

If you want to edit it, you can do the first 2 steps from before and open ```HillClimb.sln``` in Microsoft Visual Studio.

Alternatively, if you only want to view the code, you can do that by opening the files which have ```.cs``` extension. 
(The code execution starts in the Game1.cs file)

If it doesn't launch, it means you don't have ```.Net``` installed on your computer.
This can be solved easily by following tutorials provided by Microsoft on how to install the required stuff.
